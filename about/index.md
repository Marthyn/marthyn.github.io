  <a href="github.com/marthyn">I'm <b>Marthyn</b></a> and I am a software developer working at Hoppinger,
    doing freelance development work and open source stuff in Ruby, Rails, Javascript
    and aspiring to learn Prolog, Elixir, Haskell. Other than programming I love to watch sports,
    especially with engines! The topic's I write about vary from tech, cooking, comics, movies,
    sports and who knows whatever I'll find interesting!'
