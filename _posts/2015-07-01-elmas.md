<center><b>Elmas</b> is an open source api wrapper written in Ruby.</center>

Elmas is a Rubygem I created by myself during my time at Hoppinger. It's an API wrapper for the Exact Online system. The challenge here was to set it up so resources would take minimal time to add, so the whole wrapper is very abstract and I used a lot of meta programming in it.

## Help

If you want to create an app for the Exact App store in Ruby this is where you should start, it has full support from Exact themselves, and is actively maintained by myself. If you have a feature request please go to [https://github.com/exactonline/exactonline-api-ruby-client](Elmas). For the near feature we want to implement the new Webhook feature.

## Why?

We created this API wrapper for the website Gites, a major player in the holiday homes market, winner of many awards. They wanted to switch from Xero to Exact online and needed a way to store customer and invoice information automatically in Exact. Through this gem it made it a lot easier.
