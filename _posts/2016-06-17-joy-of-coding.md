> Celebrating the art, craft, science and joy of software development

A conference not purely to learn something but to remember after many many busy weeks/months of programming that there's not only deadlines, demanding customers and frustrating problems to solve. Programming is joyful and we should have more fun with it!

For me this edition was as, if not more, inspiring as the last time. Last year it inspired me to develop a small <a href="{{ site.url}}/hubot-praise">Hubot plugin</a> because of a talk by Ben Straub! This year once again there were many fun and inspiring talks, here is a list of my favourites.

# Philip Wadler

Professor at Edinbrough university, a very very smart man. In the beginning I had quite a hard time following his talk on category theory. And I'd have trouble explaining to you what it is exactly. But it got my head churning and it was actually a great start of the day. It inspired me to read more into this category theory and in general to read more about origins of programming languages.

It also helped that he is witty guy and he dressed as Lambda Man!!
