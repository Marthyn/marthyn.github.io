<center><b>smallxamples</b> is an open source collection of small and easy to understand code snippets.</center>

The goal for me is to achieve managable goals of learning new languages and expressing creativity through code. As well as learn new paradigms in languages and frameworks I already know. Last but not least I hope to reach people trying to learn.
