> "The goal is clear: world champion"

Max Verstappen is having a hell of a season, mind you it's only his second in Formula 1. In a year where we all expected him to 
grab that odd podium spot in an eventful Grand Prix for Torro Rosso he surpassed every expectation by winning in the 5th race. 
Of course this hadn't been possible without his move to Red Bull at the last second but still it shows his remarkable talent. 
The upgrade to Red Bull by itself is exceptional and was so unexpected. Many people didn't believe it was the right move, but boy did
 he put those people in their place. Mika Hakkinen was one of sceptics. He later apologized and ackknowledged Max' exceptional talent.
