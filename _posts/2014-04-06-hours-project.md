<center><b>Hours</b> is an open source simple time tracking app.</center>

I worked a lot on this project during my time @ [Defacto Software](http://www.defacto.nl/). It started out of frustrations with the time tracking application they used at the time, [Jurre](https://github.com/jurre), [Matthijs](https://github.com/sn3p) and [Hugo](https://github.com/dkhgh) came up with this idea.

It was an extremely fun project to work on and it was picked up by a lot of people in the Rails community. This project is also where i gained so much Rails experience and launched my adventure into open source development.
