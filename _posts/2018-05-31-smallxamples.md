> Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.

That's what Vincent van Gogh once said.

# smallxamples

Yes, i purposefully did not put a capital letter in there, it's supposed to be small ;). I've struggled a bit during my 7 year career in software with finding something creative to do next to my job. I've tried starting projects but always found they were too ambitious to complete, and when I can't complete something I will not commit to it. So I tried answering stackoverflow questions for example! That was nice but it wasn't very creative. I also tried writing blog posts! Like this one! But I'm not necessarily a good writer so that went down the drain as well. So I was thinking, it has to be small, I have to be able to complete it and I have to be somewhat good at it. From that I thought of creating smallxamples.

# What?

Yeah it's a bastardization of 2 words, small and examples. The way I learned to write code was to do small little tutorials (same way I did my [photoshop adventure](https://marthijn1990.deviantart.com/art/Mo-Inc-Logo-49234887) in my teenage years. It worked really well for me because of the instant reward, I'm a sucker for instant rewards. A dangerous habit cause it makes you very prone to addiction. So smallxamples will (one day) be a giant repository of small code examples and tutorials. I do not know if I'm going to limit it to one file, but you have to be able to understand it within an hour. It also should be executable without much trouble

# Where?

I'll write about it in this blog but the xamples will be in a Github organization called [smallxamples](https://github.com/smallxamples). I will start out with Ruby since it's a language I love. But I'll try to venture into new languages, however obscure they might be! Suggestions are more than welcome.

# How often?

Well see, that's where the problem lies. I'm still in the process of recovering from a burn-out and I shall not put any more pressure on myself than there already is, so there's no schedule! You'll see ;).
